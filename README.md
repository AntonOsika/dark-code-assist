# dark-code-assist

A code editor with additional tools, divided into various sections and with a dark theme.

On the left, there's a narrow sidebar with icons, which likely represent different tools or views, such as file explorer, search, source control, and settings. Each icon is simple and monochromatic, adhering to the overall minimalist design.

In the center, there are two main panels, one labeled 'Shell' and the other labeled 'Browser', with tabs for 'Editor' and 'Planner' visible but not active. The 'Shell' panel is a command-line interface, currently blank, suggesting it's waiting for input or a command to execute. The 'Browser' panel contains an input field at the bottom where part of a sentence can be seen: "Hey Devin, Iâ€™d like for you to benchmark Llama 2 on three different provide[r]". This indicates some form of chat or command input specific to the environment, perhaps used to interact with an AI or an automation system within the IDE. The text also indicates the process is incomplete, ending with "provide[r]", hinting at a likely typo or cutoff.

Above the input field, there's a status message that reads "Devin is waiting to start up...", suggesting that 'Devin' is a service or tool within the IDE that has not yet been initialized or is in the process of starting.

On the upper right, there's a timestamp or status indicator showing "00 | KJ | Live", which might refer to the current time in the environment, a user or project identifier (KJ), and a 'Live' status that could mean live coding, real-time collaboration, or a live connection to a server.

The overall layout suggests a modern, possibly cloud-based development setup where multiple services, including an AI named Devin, are integrated to assist with coding, debugging, and possibly deploying software. The dark color scheme is typical for reducing eye strain during long coding sessions.
